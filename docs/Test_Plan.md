## CS1632 Project 2: Requirement and Test case

### Requirement
Basic requirement must be followed:
1. Functional

  * FUNC-1 Two Players game: This is a game between 2 players, one player cannot play alone, no third player can be involved. 

  * FUNC-2 Board size : Board size is 10x10 ( horizontal is A-J, vertical is 1-10)  //works successfully -Kat

  * FUNC-3 Ship placement

    * FUNC-3.1 Ship placement input format: Must be valid characters (A-J, 1-10), in correct format: [A-J]:[1-10]; both upper and lowecase are allowed. For example A:3, d:7. //works successfully -Kat

    * FUNC-3.2 Ship number: Each player has 5 ships, 1 in each type: carrier, battleship, cruiser, submarine, destroyer.  //works successfully -Kat
	
	* FUNC-3.3 Ships size: Carrier: 5 spaces, battleship: 4 spaces, cruiser: 3 spaces, submarine: 3 spaces, destroyer: 2 spaces.  //works successfully -Kat

    * FUNC-3.4 Ship placed in horizontal or vertical only: no diagonal ship placement is allowed  //works successfully -Kat

    * FUNC-3.5 Ships overlap: No parts/ spaces in any ships can overlap.  //works successfully -Kat

    * FUNC-3.6 Ships out of bound: Ships must be placed inside board.//works successfully -Kat
  
  * FUNC-4 Player's input during game
  
	* FUNC-4.1 Player's fire must be valid: characters (A-J, 1-10), in correct format: [A-J]:[1-10]; both upper and lowecase are allowed. For example A:3, d:7.

    * FUNC-4.2 Player's turn: Player can only fire in his turn. Any input in oponent's turn must be ignored.

    * FUNC-4.3 Valid fire coordination: Player's fire coordination must be inside the board.	

    * FUNC-4.4 Duplicate fire: Player can fire a position 1 time only. Duplicate fire not allowed.
	
	* FUNC-4.5 Player quit/surrender in the middle: Player can surrender/ quit in the middle of the game. Type 'q' to quit; 's' to surrender.

  * FUNC-5 Game play	
  
    * FUNC-5.1 Ships placement must be finished before firing phase.  
    
	* FUNC-5.2 Ship sunk announcement: If all spaces in one ship are firedown, 2 players must be announced that ship has been destroyed. For example: Player 1 carrier has been destroyed.
    
    * FUNC-5.3 Ship hit/miss announcement: If a fire hit a ship, both players must be announced that fire was a hit, otherwise they should be announced it was a miss.
    
    * FUNC-5.4 Winner decision: If a player's all 5 ships has been destroyed, the game should announce a winner and finish.

    * FUNC-5.5 Time limit: Player has limited time to make decision. Place the ship: 2 min maximum. Each turn: 30 second. For any reasons (afk, game client crash, internet lost) a player cannot finish his move, he's considered to lose the match.
	
	* FUNC-5.6 Oponent ship disclosure: Player cannot see oponent's ship placement.
	
	* FUNC-5.7 Player must switch turn after every fire.

2. Non Functional

  * NONFUNC-1 Game client must run on all 3 operating system Linux/Windows/Mac.

  * NONFUNC-2 Game server must run on Ja  * language:

  * NONFUNC-2 Players can connect to server and play through network.

  
3. Optional Requirement (to make game more enjoyable; you can have more of them)
  * Random start: who start firing first will be random
  * Multiple game simultaneously: server can handles multiple games at the same time
  * No ship movement: should be a basic requirement, but it's not really necessary
  * Type 'help' to show game's rules
  * etc...
  
### Test Case
Most of the test cases are from @Team6. Thanks for your contribution. 
For simple traceability, test cases are named with same requirement function number. For example test case TC-1a and TC-1b belongs to FUNC-1; TC-Non1a belongs to NONFUNC-1
To find more bugs, for each requirement you can have  your own new test cases. Belows I list simple examples for each requirement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Execution Steps: Player 1 should launch the client program and attempt to join a
game server that is currently empty.
  * Post Conditions: Player 1 should be allowed to join the game server and should be
placed into a game. The game server should have * one player after this test. The
game should not start and should instead wait for a second player.

TC-1b: TEST-PLAYER_2_CONNECT
  * Test Case: This is a test to see what happens when a second player attempts to
join a game server that is already occupied by one other player.
  * Preconditions: There is one player currently in the specified game server.

A1 and proceed with the same exact firing pattern as the first
sweep
    * At the end of the second sweep, as long as everything worked as it should have , the first player’s turn shouldn’t have  ended and they should then fire upon A6, which will g  * them an output and switch to the second player’s turn
    * Player 2 will pick up from step 2 and continue from there
  * Output Values
    * Initial Sweep: If a ship is hit within this sweep, it should display a message with the ship that is hit. If the fire is a miss then it will declare that as a miss.
    * Second Sweep: All fires except the final (A6) will return an error message stating that the particular coordinate has already been fired upon
  * Postconditions
    * Initial Sweep: the turn will change to the other player’s turn
